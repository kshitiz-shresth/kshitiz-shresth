# Bakery Packaging Illustration Concept

## Central Focus: Sheaves of Wheat

- **Arrangement:**
  - Bundle of wheat sheaves tied together with rustic, natural twine.
  - Sheaves arranged in a slightly fanned-out formation, creating a sense of abundance and earthiness.

- **Detailing:**
  - Intricate details like individual wheat kernels and subtle grain textures to highlight the quality and artisanal nature of the bread.

## Background and Colors

- **Color Palette:**
  - Use warm, earthy tones—golden yellows, soft browns, and muted greens.
  - Colors evoke the natural, wholesome quality of the ingredients.

- **Background:**
  - Textured background mimicking linen or burlap fabric to enhance the artisanal feel.
  - Alternatively, a soft, gradient wash of color to keep the focus on the wheat sheaves.

## Additional Elements

- **Hand-drawn Touch:**
  - Hand-drawn or watercolor style for a personal and artisanal touch, aligning with the craft of sourdough baking.

- **Logo Integration:**
  - Subtle integration of the logo into the illustration—perhaps as a small stamp or emblem on the twine tying the sheaves together.

## Typography

- **Font Choice:**
  - Use a font that complements the hand-drawn style of the illustration.
  - Consider a serif or script font for the bakery’s name and additional text.
