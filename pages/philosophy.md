# Philosophy

As a software engineer, I believe in building with intention. My development philosophy is grounded in a few key principles:

- **Simplicity**: Write clean, simple code that is easy to understand and maintain.
- **Scalability**: Always consider how a system can grow in the future, designing with scalability in mind.
- **Performance**: Strive for efficient, performant applications that deliver a smooth user experience.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure the codebase remains organized, documented, and easy to update, so future developers can step in seamlessly.
- **Security**: Prioritize building secure applications to protect user data and ensure trustworthiness.

These principles guide every project I take on, ensuring that the end product is both reliable and adaptable.
